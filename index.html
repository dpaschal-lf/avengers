                            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet,
                            in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
                            The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

                            As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine.
                            That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

                            Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process
                            which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.
